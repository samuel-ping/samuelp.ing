  Hi! I'm Samuel Ping, and I'm a sophomore at Rutgers University- New Brunswick
  studying computer science and business. Back in 3rd grade, I wanted to be an
  inventor when I grew up. I've unconsciously followed that aspiration
  throughout my life, from spending hours in the middle of my pile of Legos, to
  enjoying robotics classes, until I took my first introductory computer
  programming course in 8th grade which sparked my interest in computer science.
  Recently, I realized that building things is my passion. Since then, I've been
  pursuing my passion for creating new things.


  Apart from programming, I love playing tennis, acting, and tinkering with computer hardware. I'm also a fan of all things green! Except boogers.
