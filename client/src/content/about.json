  "body": "Hi! I'm Samuel Ping, and I'm a junior at Rutgers University- New Brunswick studying computer science and business. Back in 3rd grade, I wanted to be an inventor when I grew up. I've unconsciously followed that aspiration throughout my life, from spending hours in the middle of my pile of Legos, to enjoying robotics classes, until I took my first introductory computer programming course in 8th grade which sparked my interest in computer science. Recently, I realized that building things is my passion. Since then, I've been pursuing my passion for creating new things.\n\nApart from programming, I love playing tennis, acting, and tinkering with computer hardware. I'm also a fan of all things green! Except boogers."
