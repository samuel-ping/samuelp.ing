<ins>**Summary**</ins>

My personal website is built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. I set up Netlify CMS to make simplify content creation, as well as Matomo on an AWS EC2 instance to keep track of page clicks.

This is the third iteration of my personal website!

<ins>**Previous Versions**</ins>

**v2**: I didn't like my first version, so I remade it.

**v1**: The [original version of my personal website](https://samuel-ping.github.io/personal-website-v1) was also my first time using React. I built it after Food Mood v1, so I had a basic understanding of web development and wanted to transfer that knowledge to React. Frankly, my first website was a bit of a mess, but I do think I'm a bit better at web development now. While I'm not the best at it, at least I know I'm capable of cranking out a website if I need to!
