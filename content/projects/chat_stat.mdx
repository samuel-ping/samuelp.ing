Chat_Stat is a command-line tool that parses message history and displays charts and statistics about the messaging history. When I wrote this program, I made an effort to follow Python best practices, which included:

- Using a config file over global variables.
- Creating a Python virtual environment and using a `requirements.txt` file to keep track of Pip packages.
- Organizing my code by splitting my it into multiple files.
- Documenting each function I wrote, as well as how to install and use the tool.

In addition to those, I also learned about many other topics. This includes:

- Object-oriented programming in Python.
- Python data structures.
- Stopwords and other methods of cleaning data. While there's no AI going on in my tool, it was interesting to learn that stopwords are commonly used to clean data in natural language processing.
