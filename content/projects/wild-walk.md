## Summary

A web app built for mobile devices, where you can check native species of plants and animals in your state, and upload pictures of them to your collection. You can view your collection to see the past species that you collected.

I built this as an entry to BackyardHacks 2020 and is not a finished product. It was my first time using a database in an application and while it worked locally, the deployed version does not work. I did learn how to use Postman, which I used to test the endpoints of the NatureServe REST API.
