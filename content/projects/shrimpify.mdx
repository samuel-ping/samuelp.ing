Image file size optimization server. I originally built this to automatically shrink images for my [PlantFam app](/projects/plantfam), but then I realized that wasn't exactly an offline-first approach for my mobile application. So now I just have this image compression API and I don't know what to do with it.

This project is named after my little Echeveria fleur blanc succulent, Shrimp (you can see her on a [404](/404)!).
