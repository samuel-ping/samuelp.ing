## Summary

My personal website is built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. I also picked up a little Figma and created a [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/jTaIHRr5oJLSE8uI1eg0YJ/personal-site?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=BTqMOZDl8YAzO1H5-1) of the site!

## Past Features

### Netlify CMS

I originally added Netlify CMS to simplify content creation on my site. I hosted a server on Heroku to authenticate me to access my CMS. Unfortunately Heroku/Salesforce terminated their free hosting plan so I got rid of it.

### Matomo Analytics

In the past, I had also set up Matomo Analytics for fun, to see where in the world people are looking at my website from! But my server was secretly hosted on an anonymous AWS employee's account and sadly they don't work there anymore.

## Previous Versions

**[v3](https://v3.samuelp.ing/)**: I didn't like my second version, so I remade it.

**[v1](https://samuel-ping.github.io/personal-website-v1)**: The original version of my personal website was also my first time using React. I built it after Food Mood v1, so I had a basic understanding of web development and wanted to transfer that knowledge to React. Frankly, my first website was a bit of a mess, but I do think I'm a bit better at web development now. While I'm not the best at it, at least I know I'm capable of cranking out a website if I need to!
