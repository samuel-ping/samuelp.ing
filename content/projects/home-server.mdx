## Summary

I built a home server. It's running on [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) and is hosting a bunch of random services.

## Why?

I used to have unlimited Google Photos storage with my university Google account, but they got rid of that. So, I was stuck with either paying a dollar or two monthly for storage, _orrr_ I could shell out several hundred bucks to host my own [photos server](https://immich.app/). I mean, the answer was obvious here. My server is gonna pay itself off in like, 10 years.

On top of that, I quickly found out that having my own server was much more useful than just for hosting my photos. If there's software I want, it probably exists out there in some open-source form. There's also software I did not know I wanted that I'm now hosting for myself. I can host personal projects, game servers, you name it, I can host it (probably, if we don't take into account resource limits). No longer do I need to bribe AWS employee to host my things for me 8)

## Cool Services

- [Immich](https://immich.app/): amazing self-hosted alternative to Google Photos.
- [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org/): super sleek budgeting software.
- [occ-loo-pied](/projects/occ-loo-pied): my bathroom occupancy checker's server :D
- [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/): notification server. I use it to get push notifications on my phone for various services.
- [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/): dns that lets me block ads at the router level.
