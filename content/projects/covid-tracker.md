## Summary

This web app tells you the current number of COVID-19 cases in your state, as well as other useful information. It is intended to be a quick and easy tool that nearly instantly retrieves relevant data. This project was submitted to TCNJ HackDown Fall 2020, and we won Best Halloween Hack!

I made this project with a mentee and a friend who were both new to hackathons and web development. Because of that, I tried to mentor them throughout the hackathon, and it all worked out in the end!
