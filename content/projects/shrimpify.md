Image file size optimization server. I originally built this to automatically shrink images for my PlantFam app, but then I realized that wasn't exactly an offline-first approach for my mobile application. So now I just have this image compression API and I don't know what to do with it.

This project is named after my little Echeveria fleur blanc succulent, Shrimp.
