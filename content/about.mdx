Hey there! I'm Sam Ping. I recently graduated from Rutgers University- New Brunswick with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration. I'm currently based in the greater NYC area.

#### Why computer science?

Back in 3rd grade, I wanted to be an inventor when I grew up. I've unconsciously followed that aspiration throughout my life, from spending hours in the middle of my pile of Legos, to enjoying robotics classes, to rooting my phone so I could hack games and get infinite cash. I took my first introductory computer programming course in 8th grade which sparked my interest in computer science. I've come to realize that building things is my passion, so I've been pursuing that ever since.

#### What else do I do?

I love playing tennis, climbing, acting, and tinkering with computer hardware. I had a big plant phase over quarantine, and while I've toned down on that now, I will still drag anyone into a plant shop if we walk past one. I'm also a fan of all things green! Except boogers.
