Hey there! I'm Sam Ping. In 2023, I graduated from Rutgers University- New Brunswick with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration. Nowadays, I'm based in New York City.

#### Why computer science?

Back in 3rd grade, I wanted to be an inventor when I grew up. I've unconsciously followed that aspiration throughout my life, from spending hours in the middle of my pile of Legos, to enjoying robotics classes, to rooting my phone so I could hack games and get infinite cash.

I got my first taste of computer science when I took my first introductory computer programming course in 8th grade, but the real spark for me was in freshman year of college, when I participated in Capital One's Software Engineering Summit. That's a [whole story](https://github.com/samuel-ping/food-mood?tab=readme-ov-file#story) in itself- long story short, it was my first time building a website and I was hooked.

Since then, I've come to realize that building things is my passion, so I've been pursuing that ever since. Building this website was like playing with Legos!

#### What else do I do?

I love playing tennis, acting, and tinkering with my home server. I run a bit (hoping to run the NYC marathon!) but I can't say I enjoy it that much. I had a big plant phase over quarantine, and while I've toned down on that now, I will still drag anyone I'm with into a plant shop if we walk past one :)
