# Personal Website

This is my personal website's repository! Hopefully you're here because you like my website.

## Stack

I built my website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

### Past Stuff

#### Netlify CMS

I originally added Netlify CMS to simplify content creation on my site. I hosted a server on Heroku to authenticate me to access my CMS. Unfortunately Heroku/Salesforce terminated their free hosting plan so I got rid of it.

#### Matomo Analytics

In the past, I had also set up Matomo Analytics for fun, to see where in the world people are looking at my website from! But my server was secretly hosted on an anonymous AWS employee's account and sadly they don't work there anymore.
