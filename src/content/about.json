  "body": "Hi! I'm Sam Ping, and I'm a senior at Rutgers University- New Brunswick studying computer science and business. Back in 3rd grade, I wanted to be an inventor when I grew up. I've unconsciously followed that aspiration throughout my life, from spending hours in the middle of my pile of Legos, to enjoying robotics classes, to rooting my phone so I could hack games and get infinite cash. I took my first introductory computer programming course in 8th grade which sparked my interest in computer science. I've come to realize that building things is my passion, so I've been pursuing my passion for creating new things ever since.\n\nApart from programming, I love playing tennis, acting, and tinkering with computer hardware. I'm also a fan of all things green! Except boogers."
