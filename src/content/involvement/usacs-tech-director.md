USACS (short for Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists) is the largest general computer science-related club at Rutgers.

### April 2021 - May 2022: Tech Director

I was the tech director for USACS, and my job was to promote hacker culture and inspire project building in the Rutgers computer science community. I organized events such as USACS Labs, where I held a weekly office hours to help students build personal projects. At the end of each semester, I held RU Tech Meetup, an event where people showcase the cool projects they created over the past semester. My favorite event that I organized was UHaccs, a hackathon geared towards people who have not participated in a hackathon before. This one-day event attracted almost 50 students and was a great success!

### October 2020 - May 2021: Mentor

I mentored two computer science undergraduate at Rutgers. I gave them advice about academics, college, internship hunting, and more. I also made them a [simple website](https://samuel-ping.github.io/intro-to-git/) to teach them the basics of Git!... unfortunately they never used it :(

### September 2019 - Present: Member

I attended and contributed to weekly town halls. I also mentored at a local high school hackathon.
